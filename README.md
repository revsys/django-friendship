# django-friendship

[![CI](https://github.com/revsys/django-friendship/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/revsys/django-friendship/actions/workflows/actions.yml)

This application enables you to create and manage follows, blocks and bi-directional friendships between users. It features:

- Friendship request objects that can be accepted, rejected, canceled, or marked as viewed.
- Hooks to easily list all friend requests sent or received by a given user, filtered by the status of the request.
- A blocklist for each user of users they've blocked.
- Tags to include information about friendships, blocks and follows in your templates.
- Integration with `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
- Validation to prevent common mistakes.
- Faster server response time through caching

## Requirements

Django 5.0 and 5.1 + Python 3.11 and Python 3.12 support added **>v1.9.6**

Previously: 

- **Django 3.2 since v1.9.1**
- **Django 1.11+** since v1.7.0 (latest release supporting **Django 1.10** is v1.6.0)

## Installation

1. `pip install django-friendship`
2. add `"friendship"` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and run `python manage.py migrate`.
3. Use the friendship manager in your own views, or wire up the URLconf to include the builtin views:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('friendship/', include('friendship.urls'))
    ...
]
```

Note: If you are migrating from django-friendship `v1.6.x`, you'll need to rollback your migrations and fake
migration `0002`

```shell
$ ./manage.py migrate friendship 0001
$ ./manage.py migrate friendship 0002 --fake
```

If you're migrating from `v1.7.x`, you'll likely have to fake `0003` as well:

```shell
$ ./manage.py migrate friendship 0003 --fake
```

## Usage

`django-friendship` provides a free API that gives you several ways to create and manage friendship requests or follows in your views. Add the following at the top of your `views.py`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from friendship.models import Friend, Follow, Block
```

### Getting Data about Friendships

- List all of a user's friends: `Friend.objects.friends(request.user)`
- List all unread friendship requests: `Friend.objects.unread_requests(user=request.user)`
- List all unrejected friendship requests: `Friend.objects.unrejected_requests(user=request.user)`
- Count of all unrejected friendship requests: `Friend.objects.unrejected_request_count(user=request.user)`
- List all rejected friendship requests: `Friend.objects.rejected_requests(user=request.user)`
- Count of all rejected friendship requests: `Friend.objects.rejected_request_count(user=request.user)`
- List of all sent friendship requests: `Friend.objects.sent_requests(user=request.user)`
- Test if two users are friends: `Friend.objects.are_friends(request.user, other_user) == True`

### Getting Data about Follows

- List of a user's followers: `Follow.objects.followers(request.user)`
- List of who a user is following: `Follow.objects.following(request.user)`

### Getting Data about Blocks

- List of a user's blockers: `Block.objects.blocked(request.user)`
- List of who a user is blocking: `Block.objects.blocking(request.user)`
- Test if a user is blocked: `Block.objects.is_blocked(request.user, other_user) == True`

### Managing Friendships and Follows

#### Create a friendship request:

```python
other_user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
Friend.objects.add_friend(
    request.user,                               # The sender
    other_user,                                 # The recipient
    message='Hi! I would like to add you')      # This message is optional
```

#### Let the user who received the request respond:

```python
from friendship.models import FriendshipRequest

friend_request = FriendshipRequest.objects.get(from_user=request.user, to_user=other_user)
friend_request.accept()
# or friend_request.reject()
```

#### To remove the friendship relationship between `request.user` and `other_user`, do the following:

```python
Friend.objects.remove_friend(request.user, other_user)
```

#### Make request.user a follower of other_user:

```python
Follow.objects.add_follower(request.user, other_user)
```


#### Make request.user block other_user:

```python
Block.objects.add_block(request.user, other_user)
```

#### Make request.user unblock other_user:

```python
Block.objects.remove_block(request.user, other_user)
```

### Templates

You can use `django-friendship` tags in your templates. First enter:

```django

```

Then use any of the following:

```django
{% friends request.user %}
{% followers request.user %}
{% following request.user %}
{% friend_requests request.user %}
{% blockers request.user %}
{% blocking request.user %}
```

### Signals

- friendship_request_canceled
- friendship_request_accepted
- friendship_removed
- follower_created
